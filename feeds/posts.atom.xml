&lt;p&gt;Let's face it: for many of us parents, the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic couldn't have come at a worse time.  Not only do we have a legitimate fear of dying every time we step out of the house into a public place, we also have to face the reality that schools around the U.S. will be closed for &lt;a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-schools-closed-coronavirus-kate-brown-april-28/"&gt;over a month&lt;/a&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's face it: for many of us parents, the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic couldn't have come at a worse time.  Not only do we have a legitimate fear of dying every time we step out of the house into a public place, we also have to face the reality that schools around the U.S. will be closed for &lt;a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-schools-closed-coronavirus-kate-brown-april-28/"&gt;over a month&lt;/a&gt;...and potentially for &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-17/schools-closures-mobilize-meals"&gt;the rest of the school year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that thought doesn't make your stomach sink to the floor, I don't know what will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of us, this means we will be working from home &amp;mdash; for others, this means we may not be able to work at all for the foreseeable future.  Although there is little we can do to control what is happening around us, what we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; control is the type and amount of information and activities our children are exposed to during this time. Tempting as it is to turn on Netflix, Hulu, or Disney+ and walk away until our school districts finalize a plan for online education, what we do now with our kids could have a tremendous impact on their lives down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, keeping our children off of electronics is ideal, but it isn't always possible &amp;mdash; particularly if we are still working from home and cannot spend the weekdays conjuring up alternate entertainment.  However, this doesn't mean our children should have free rein on the Internet.  Though often forgotten, computers have incredible educational potential with the Internet turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of knowing how to code is that you can create your own computer learning environments for your children.  In fact, you may have already done so without realizing it.  When first learning a programming language, we tend to make simple command line games to gain a grasp on logical control flow, loops, string methods, etc.  Whether it is a magic 8-ball, a choose-your-own-adventure story, battleship, or something else, you can easily set it up for some internet-free and child-friendly computer entertainment.  In my case, one of the earlier projects I worked on was a program to help my son with his multiplication, which you can find &lt;a href="https://github.com/aedwardg/times-tables"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple programs such as these can be lifesavers when you need to focus on your own tasks and do not want to worry about looking over your shoulder to monitor your child's internet usage.  If you know how to code, it might be worth the time to check out some of your old work for hidden gems like my &lt;code&gt;TimesTables&lt;/code&gt; program or even write up a new program over the weekend.  If coding isn't your thing, but you have young children who could use some math practice, feel free to download &lt;code&gt;TimesTables&lt;/code&gt; from my github and have your children take a crack at it.  Either way, it might buy you an hour or two of peace as you try navigate the this new, quasi-apocalyptic world while simultaneously feeding, educating and entertaining your children.  I wish you all the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never been an avid blogger.  Perhaps because it's tedious to come up with material for a general purpose blog, or perhaps because I never felt I had any novel material to contiribute to society as a whole.  The deeper I've delved in to world of data science, however, the more I've seen how integral blogging has become to the expansion and success of this field.  Blog posts are where machine learning pioneers first share their findings, and simultaneously where budding data scientists look for others in their same position &amp;mdash; students floundering their way through the ever-expanding technological and mathematical barriers to entry.  More than once, I've found myself in the same shoes: scouring blogs for tips on career changes, statistical concepts, applicable code and success stories.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now, more than two years after my initial forray into the world of Python, I'm taking the advice of &lt;a href="https://www.fast.ai/"&gt;fast.ai&lt;/a&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

Now, more than two years after my initial forray into the world of Python, I'm taking the advice of &lt;a href="https://www.fast.ai/"&gt;fast.ai&lt;/a&gt; co-founder, Dr. Rachel Thomas, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045"&gt;starting my own blog&lt;/a&gt;.  My goal is to not only document what I'm working on, but to help others who've taken the same brave step to transform their careers through data.  As Dr. Thomas wisely said, "You are best positioned to help people one step behind you."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Although I don't particularly believe in making New Year Resolutions, my goal is to share either a post or a project at least once a month as I continue to learn throughout 2020.  Perhaps a month or two (or 10) down the road, another self-taught data scientist will find inspiration in the work and perspective I share here.&lt;/p&gt;
